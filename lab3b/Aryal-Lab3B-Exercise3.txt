I created and ran the program and the program spawned a child process through fork.
The child printed I am the child 0 and called the ls command with execlp ().
ls which showed all the files in the present directory.

The parent process wrote out I am the parent
|human|>where was the process ID of the child.
The parent would then wait until the child process was finished after which he/she would print Child Complete.

This illustrates how fork and exec works whereby fork creates a new process and the child process is substituted 
by the exec.
with a different program. The output results were that the processes were carried out in a serial manner.
The parent had waited till the child was over.
